# CSE 210 Developer Project: HILO
This runs the HiLo guessing game in the console.

The structure of this is that there is a director class. This class cordinates the interaction
between the parachute, the the word, and the terminal. The terminal recieves intput and displays
output based on the user actions. The word takes care of all the guess handling, and the parachute
keeps track of the players life.

The required software for this is just .NET so that you can run C#.
